Open Source Day Flattr Chrome Extension
=======================================

This extension for Google Chrome displays a Flattr icon in the address field when the website you are on can be flattred. Clicking the icon takes you to the thing page on flattr.com!

Recursive Search
-------
If no direct match is found, the base domain and up to 9 urls 'back' from the current URL will be searched in an attempt to find a flattr match. The extension options page allows the user turn off recursive search, control the depth of the recursion, and explains this concept in further detail.

Testing
-------
 1. Clone this repo.
 2. In Chrome: Tools -> Extensions.
 3. Click the + "Developer mode".
 4. Click 'Load unpacked extension' and choose the repo folder.
